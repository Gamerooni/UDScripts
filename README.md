## Projects

### UDPatcher

Synthesis patcher to patch various DD items to work with UD devices. Functionality is identical to [the FOMOD](https://github.com/IHateMyKite/UnforgivingDevices_FOMOD/tree/main), but with far greater configurability.

#### How-To (Basic)

1. Select the mods you wish to patch in the Settings (as well as any other mods these mods pull relevant records from - not necessarily the masters)
1. Set the other Settings as desired (currently there are no Default settings, this will soon be rectified)
1. Run the Synthesis patcher with only this patcher selected
1. Rename the resulting patch in xEdit to an appropriate name

Alternatively, you can simply run the patcher along other Synthesis scripts and leave everything in the one `Synthesis.esp`.
